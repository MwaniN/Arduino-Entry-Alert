# Arduino-Entry-Alert

This was made for an Arduino microcontroller hooked up to a soundboard and two motion sensors. 

The plan was to make it so that depending on your direction and speed a different sound would be played.

This worked in testing yet depending on the environment the sensors seemed not to cooperate.

It was fun to make though :D
